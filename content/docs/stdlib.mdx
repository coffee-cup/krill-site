title: "Standard Library"
---

There is a standard library that is always loaded first. The library is small
and can be found [here](https://github.com/coffee-cup/krill/blob/master/stdlib/core.kr).

## print

Print the argument to standard out.

```hs
print :: a -> ()
print $ [1,2] ++ " hello"
# => [1,2] hello
```
