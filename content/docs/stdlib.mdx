# Standard Library

This section details all functions that are globally available in the language.
Most of them are builtin to the compiler. Some are part of the
[stdlib](https://github.com/coffee-cup/krill/blob/master/stdlib/core.kr) that is
loaded first.

The Krill standard library is data last. This means that the main data you pass
to a function will always be the last argument. This allows you to more easily
create complex functions by composing together smaller functions, and then
passing in your data last.

## print

Print the argument to standard out.

```hs
print :: a -> ()
print "Hello, World!"
# => Hello, World!
```

## length

Get the length of a list or string.

```hs
length :: [a] -> Number
length [1,2,3] == 3
length "hello" == 5
```

## not

The same as the logical not operator (`!`).

```hs
not :: Bool -> Bool
not true == false
not false == true
```

## id

The identity function.

```hs
id :: a -> a
id 1 == 1
id :hello = :hello
```

## const

Returns the first argument.

```hs
const :: a -> b -> a
const 1 2 == 1
const true false == true
```

## map

Apply a function to every element of a list and return the result.

```hs
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map (x -> x * x) [1,2,3]
# => [1,4,9]
```

## foldl

Combine elements of a list by applying a function over the elements from
left-to-right.

```hs
foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
foldl (acc current -> acc - current) 0 [1,2,3]
# => -6
```

## foldr

Combine elements of a list by applying a function over the elements from
right-to-left.

```hs
foldr :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
foldr (acc current -> acc - current) 0 [1,2,3]
# => 2
```

## reduce

Alias for `foldl`.

## filter

Return new list of elements that pass a predicate.

```hs
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter (x -> x % 2 == 0) [1,2,3,4,5]
# => [2,4]
```

## sum

Sum all the elements of a list.

```hs
sum :: [Number] -> Number
sum [1,2,3]
# => 6
```

## min

Return the min of both arguments.

```hs
min :: Number -> Number -> Number
min 1 2 == 1
```

## max

Return the max of both arguments.

```hs
max :: Number -> Number -> Number
max 1 2 == 2
```

## flatten

Recursively flattens a list.

```hs
flatten :: [a] -> [a]
flatten [[1,2,3], [[1,2], [1], 2], []]
# => [1,2,3,1,2,1,2]
```

## split

Split a string on a delimiter. Splitting on the empty string breaks string into
list of character.

```hs
split :: String -> String -> [String]
split " " "this is some text" = ["this", "is", "some", "text"]
split "" "hello" == ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

## intersperse

Insert a value in between every element of a list.

```hs
intersperse :: a -> [b] -> [c]
intersperse "," ["hello", "world"] == ["hello", "," ,"world"]
intersperse 0 [1, 2, 3] == [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]
```

## join

Concat every element of a list together separated by a delimiter. The result is
always a string.

```hs
join :: a -> [b] -> String
join " " ["hello", "world"] == "hello world"
join 0 [1, 2, 3] == "10203"
```

## trim

Remove leading and trailing whitespace.

```hs
trim :: String -> String
trim "\n  Hello, World!     " == "Hello, World!"
```

## lines

Split input string on all newlines.

```hs
lines :: String -> [String]
lines "hello\nworld" == ["hello", "world"]
```

## words

Split input string on all word breaks.

```hs
words :: String -> [String]
words "  hello    world" == ["hello", "world"]
```

## charToCode

Get the ascii code of a character.

```hs
charToCode :: Char -> Number
charToCode 'a' == 97
```

## codeToChar

Convert ascii value to a character. The input must be an integer between 0 and 127.

```hs
codeToChar :: Number -> Char
codeToChar 97 == 'a'
```

## toNumber

Try to convert input to a number. Throws an error if it cannot.

```hs
toNumber :: a -> Bool
toNumber "3" == 3
toNumber "hello"
# => Error: Could not parse "hello" to a number
```

## toString

Convert input to a string.

```hs
toString :: a -> String
toString [1,2] == "[1,2]"
toString true == "true"
```

## isList

Check if input is a number

```hs
isList :: a -> Bool
isList [1,2] == true
isList 1 == false
```

## isNumber

Check if input is a number.

```hs
isNumber :: a -> Bool
isNumber "hello" == false
isNumber 1 == true
```

## isString

Check if input is a string.

```hs
isString :: a -> Bool
isString "hello" == true
isString 1 == false
```

## isBool

Check if input is a bool.

```hs
isBool :: a -> Bool
isBool true == true
isBool "hello" == false
```

## isAtom

Check if input is an atom.

```hs
isBool :: a -> Bool
isBool :hello == true
isBool "hello" == false
```

## date

Get the current date in "year-month-day" format.

```hs
date :: _ -> String
date () == "2019-5-11"
```

## time

Get the current time in "hour:minute" format.

```hs
time :: _ -> String
time () == "17:40"
```

## readFile

Read a file from disk. Throw and error if file not found.

```hs
readFile :: String -> String
```

## writeFile

Write a string to a file on disk. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

```hs
writeFile :: String -> String -> ()
```

## appendFile

Append to a file on disk. The file is created if it doesn't exist.

```hs
writeFile :: String -> String -> ()
```

## pow

Raise the first argument to the power of the second.

```hs
pow 2 3 == 8
```

## root

Get the nth root of an argument.

```hs
root 3 8 == 2
```

## sqrt

Get the square root of the argument.

```hs
sqrt 25 == 5
```

## floor

Floor the input.

```

## assert

## args

Special variable that contains all arguments passed to krill. This is only
non-empty when running a file.

```hs
# src/file.kr
print args
```

```
krill src/file.kr hello world
["/src/file.kr", "hello", "world"]
```
