# Syntax

## Literals

Everything in Krill can be boiled down to these values.

| Literal | Sample Values      |
|:--------|--------------------|
| Numbers | `1`, `1.5`         |
| Strings | `"hello"`          |
| Chars   | `'a'`              |
| Bools   | `true`, `false`    |
| Atoms   | `:hello`, `:world` |
| Unit    | `()`               |

The unit value is like the `null` value in other languages. It is often used
when a lambda does not return anything.

## Comments

Comments start with a hash `#` and extend to the rest of the line.

```hs
print "hello" # this text is ignore
```

## Variables

You can define variables easily

```haskell
x = 2
```

Variables are immutable

```haskell
x = 2
x = 1 # Error: Variable `x` Already Bound
```

## Blocks

Blocks are a single expression, or multiple expression inside some curlies. They
cannot be used by themselves, but are used in a few places throughout the syntax.

## Lambdas

There are no top level functions in krill, only lambas (which are occasionally
referred to as functions in the documentation). A lambda is a set of space
separated parameters followed by an arrow `->`. The body of a lambda is a block.
The following two lambdas are equivalent.

```
add1 = a b -> a + b

add2 = a b -> {
  result = a + b
  result
}
```

The last expression in a block is returned.

You can create a lambda that accepts no parameters by using the underscore and
calling it with the unit value.

```haskell
printHello = _ -> print "hello"
printHello ()
# => "hello"
```

## Lists

Lists are as you expect

```haskell
l = [1,2,3]
l[1]
# => 2
```

You can also creates lists with ranges that work the same way as in Haskell.

```haskell
[1..10]
# => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

[1,3..10]
# => [1,3,5,7,9]
```

## Ifs

Since everything in krill is an expression, if's must return a value, meaning
the else block must be provided.

```haskell
if x == 2 then "x is two!" else {
  "x is not two."
}
```

## For Loops

You can loop over lists with the for in syntax.

```haskell
for i in [1..5] { print i }
# => 1
# => 2
# => 3
# => 4
# => 5
```

## Operators

| Precedence  | Operator                         | Description                       | Associativity |
|-------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| 1 (highest) | `.`                              | Function composition              | Right         |
| 2           | `!`, `-`                         | Unary not and negate              |               |
| 3           | `*`, `/`, `%`                    | Multiplication, division, modulus | Left          |
| 4           | `++`                             | Concat                            | Left          |
| 5           | `+`, `-`                         | Addition and subtraction          | Left          |
| 6           | `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>` | Compare operators                 |               |
| 7           | `&&`                             | Logical AND                       | Right         |
| 7           | `||`                             | Logical OR                        | Right         |
| 9 (lowest)  | `$`                              | Paren Avoider                     | Right         |

The function compose operator composes together two functions.

```hs
(f . g) x == f (g x)
```

The `$` operator will evaluate the entire right side before the left. It is
useful when you want to avoid parens.

```hs
f $ x + 1 = f (x + 1)
```
