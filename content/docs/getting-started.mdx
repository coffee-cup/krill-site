# Getting Started

If you are on macOS, install Krill with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 

```
brew install krill
```

If you are on another platform, [download the binary]() or [build it from
source]().

You can create a [hello world
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) by creating
a file on disk with the following contents.

```shell
print "Hello, World!"
```

Run the file with `krill file.kr`. You should see the text output to the
console.

## Using the repl

You can start a Krill repl by running the `krill` command with no arguments.

```shell
$ krill

 |  ._ o | |
 |< |  | | |

 Krill 0.1.0
```

In the repl you can type single line expressions which are evaluated
immediately. Try it out with hello world.

```
λ print "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
```

Repl commands are prefixed with the dot `.`. For example, to see the help run,

```
λ .help
```
