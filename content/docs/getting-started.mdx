# Getting Started

Install Krill from the [getting started](/getting-started) page.

You can create a [hello world
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) by creating
a file on disk with the following contents.

```shell
print "Hello, World!"
```

Run the file with `krill file.kr`. You should see the text output to the
console.

## Using the repl

You can start a Krill repl by running the `krill` command with no arguments.

```shell
$ krill

 |  ._ o | |
 |< |  | | |

 Krill 0.1.0
```

In the repl you can type single line expressions which are evaluated
immediately. Try it out with hello world.

```
Î» print "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
```

Repl commands are prefixed with the dot `.`. For example, some of the commands are:

| Command         | Description                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `.quit`         | Quit the repl                              |
| `.help`         | Show the repl help.                        |
| `.load [file]`  | Load a [file] into repl.                   |
| `.clear [name]` | Clear variable [name] from the environment |
