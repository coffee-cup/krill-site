# Getting Started

If you are on macOS, install Krill with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). 

```sh
brew install krill
```

If you are on another platform, [download the binary]() or [build it from
source]().

You can create a [hello world
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) by creating
a file on disk with the following contents.

```hs
print "Hello, World!"
```

Run the file with `krill file.kr`. You should see the text output to the
console. Alternatively you can type the command into the Repl.

```sh
$ krill

 |  ._ o | |
 |< |  | | |

 Krill 0.1.0

Î» print "Hello, World!"
Hello, World!
```
