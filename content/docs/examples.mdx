# Examples

Here you will find some example krill programs.

## Date and time

```hs
(map toNumber . split "-" . date) ()
# => [2019,5,11]

(map toNumber . split ":" . time) ()
# => [17,40]
```

## File I/O

```hs
writeFile "/var/tmp/foo" "hello world"

readFile "/var/tmp/foo"
# => "hello world"

appendFile "/var/tmp/foo" "\nhow are you?"

readFile "/var/tmp/foo"
# => hello world
# => how are you?
```


## Factorial

```hs
fac = n -> {
  if n == 0 then 1
  else n * (fac $ n - 1)
}
```

## Fibonacci

```hs
fib = n -> {
  if n == 0 then 0
  else {
   if n == 1 then 1
   else fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
  }
}
```
