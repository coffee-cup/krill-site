# Installation

Build it yourself with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

1.  Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), which we will use to compile the Haskell code.
2.  Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory.
3.  Run `stack setup` to download the correct version of GHC.
4.  Run `stack install --local-bin-path=out/build` to build the application.
5.  Copy the application binary at `out/build/krill` to wherever you need it to go.

# Usage

## Repl

Running `krill` with no arguments will launch a repl. You can `.help` in the
repl for a list of available commands. Commands are all prefixed with the `.`.
Exit the repl with `.q`.

## Run a file

You can run a file with `krill path/to/file.kr`.
